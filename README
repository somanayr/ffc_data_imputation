The scripts we used for manually imputed the data for the Fragile Families Challenge

Example usage:
The file system should be set up as:
+--ffc_documentation
|  | ff_hv_cb5.txt
|  | ff_teacher_cb5.txt
|  | etc.
+--ffc_data
|  +--original
|     | background.csv
|     | etc
|  +--imputed
|     | (empty)
+--codebook notes
|  | (empty)
| curate_codebook.py
| prepreocess.py
| impute_codebook.py

The ffc_documentation folder should be filled with the codebooks you are interested in, found here: http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/documentation

First, we need to curate the codebook and sort the questions by type. This will make it easier to impute the data later. So run:
> python curate_codebook.py -i ffc_documentation/ff_hv_cb5.txt -o codebook_notes/ff_hv_cb5.txt

Then, we need to specify how we want to impute each question where we can't automatically impute it.
> python impute_codebook.py -c ffc_documentation/ff_hv_cb5.txt -i codebook_notes/ff_hv_cb5.tsv -o imputation_notes/ff_hv_cb5.tsv -d ffc_data/original/background.csv

Repeat the above two steps for each codebook you're interested in. Be sure to substitute "ff_hv_cb5" for the codebook that you're working on. Progress is saved, so you can quit at any time and resume where you left off. If you make a mistake, you can remove the last line in imputation_notes/ff_hv_cb5.tsv to remove the mistake.

Then, we need to combine all of our outputs:
> cat codebook_notes/ff_*.tsv > codebook_notes/aggregate.tsv
> cat imputation_notes/ff_*.tsv > imputation_notes/aggregate.tsv

Finally, we need to update the Fragile Families dataset with our imputation instructions:
> python preprocess.py -d ffc_data/original/background.csv -t codebook_notes/aggregate.tsv -m imputation_notes/aggregate.tsv -v -o ffc_data/imputed/aggregate_unrestricted_nostrings.csv -sr
